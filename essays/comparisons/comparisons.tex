\chapter{Comparisons of Definitions of Chaos}
We have seen four definitions 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Positive topological entropy
  \item Devaney
  \item Block-Coppel
  \item Li-Yorke
\end{enumerate}
and their variants
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Wiggins's (similar to Devaney)
  \item Martelli (equivalent to Wiggins's in $\R^n$)
  \item Marotto (implies Li-Yorke. Requires differentiability)
\end{enumerate}
In this chapter, we discuss the relations between the first four definitions.
(Why omit the latter three?)
Throughout this chapter, we consider the dynamical system $(X,F)$, where $X$ is a metric space, and $F$ is a continuous mapping.
Specifically, we consider the case where $X$ is a compact interval, compact subset of $\R^n$, and compact metric space.


\section{Compact Interval}
Let $I \subseteq \R$ be a compact interval.
In this section, we consider the case where $X = I$.
As it turns out, Devaney's, Block-Coppel's, and positive topological entropy are equivalent conditions, and Li-Yorke's chaos is a weaker condition.

  \label{fig:chaos-interval}
  \caption{

  }
\end{figure}

Devaney's and Block-Coppel's definitions are equivalent.
\begin{theorem}
  \citep{aulbach}
  $(I,F)$ is chaotic in Devaney's sense if and only if it is chaotic in Block-Coppel's sense.
  \begin{proof}
    \citep{aulbach}
    (Use \citep{blockcoppel} VI: Proposition 6.)
    (Or via \citep{blockcoppel} VIII on entropy.)
  \end{proof}
  \label{thm:devaney-blockcoppel}
\end{theorem}

Devaney's chaos implies positive topological entropy and vice versa.
\begin{theorem}
  \citep{forti}
  $(I,F)$ is chaotic in the sense of Devaney if and only if it has positive topological entropy.
  \label{thm:devaney-entropy}
  \begin{proof}
    \citet{omegachaos}. (Questionable. See Balibrea, Snoha)
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  $(I,F)$ is chaotic in the sense of Block-Coppel if and only if it has positive topological entropy.
  \label{thm:entropy-blockcoppel}
  \begin{proof}
    This follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:devaney-blockcoppel} and Theorem~\ref{thm:devaney-entropy}.
    It is also proved in \citet[VII, Theorem 24]{blockcoppel}.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

As a side note, let us mentions that, on a compact interval, Devaney's and Wiggins's definitions are equivalent.
We mentioned in the chapter on Devaney's chaos that dense periodic orbits and topological transitivity imply sensitive dependence on initial conditions in a compact metric space.
The equivalence of Devaney's and Wiggins's definitions follows from the fact that transitivity implies dense periodic orbits.
\begin{theorem}
  $(I,F)$ is chaotic in the sense of Devaney if and only if it is chaotic in the sense of Wiggins.
  \label{thm:devaney-wiggins}
  \begin{proof}
    The same author, \citet{silverman}, has also shown that on a compact interval, topological transitivity implies the existence of dense periodic orbits and sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  \citep{blockcoppel}
  If $(I,F)$ is chaotic in Block-Coppel's sense, then it is chaotic in Li-Yorke's sense.
  \label{thm:devaney-liyorke}
  \begin{proof}
    See \citet{blockcoppel} (VI; Proposition 27).
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\citet{aulbach} and \citet{smital} show that Li-Yorke's chaos does not imply Block-Coppel and positive topological entropy, respectively.
\begin{theorem}
  \citep{aulbach, smital}
  Chaos in Li-Yorke is not a sufficient condition for chaos in Block-Coppel's sense and does not imply positive topological entropy.
  \label{thm:counterexample1}
\end{theorem}

In summary, Devaney's, Block-Coppel's, and positive topological entropy definitions are equivalent on a compact interval.
Each of the three equivalent definitions imply chaos in Li-Yorke's sense, but Li-Yorke's definition does not imply others.

\section{Compact Metric Space}
The landspace in this more general case is more interesting than the compact interval case.
AKM, Li-Yorke, and Block-Coppel are no longer equivalent.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm, auto,]
 %nodes
    \node[] (dummy) {};
    \node[box, inner sep=5pt,below=2.0cm of dummy] (ly) {Li-Yorke};
    \node[box, inner sep=5pt,left=2.0cm of dummy] (dev) {Devaney};
    \node[box, inner sep=5pt,above=2.0cm of dummy] (bc) {Block-Coppel};
    \node[box, inner sep=5pt,right=2.0cm of dummy] (entropy) {Entropy};
 %edges
    \draw[imply] (entropy)[bend left=15] to node {} (ly); 
    \draw[induced] (bc) to node {} (ly); 
    \draw[imply] (bc) to[bend left=15] node {} (entropy); 
    %??? \draw[imply] (bc) to[bend right=15] node {} (dev); 
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \label{fig:chaos-metric}
  \caption{
    Relations between definitions for a compact metric space.
    An absence of an arrow means that the particular implication is not necessarily true.
    For instance, Devaney's chaos does not imply Block-Copple's chaos.
  }
\end{figure}

A system with posivite topological entropy is chaotic in Li-Yorke's sense .
\begin{theorem}
  \citep{blanchard}
  If $(X,F)$ has positive topological entropy, then it is chaotic in Li-Yorke's sense.
  \label{thm:entropy-liyorke}
\end{theorem}

As we have seen for the compact interval case, the converse of the last theorem is not true in general.
For the same reason, Li-Yorke chaos does not imply Block-Coppel's or Devaney's chaos, either.

There exists a system that is topologically transitive and sensitive to initial conditions, but not chaotic in Li-Yorke's sense.
\begin{theorem}
  \citep{blanchard}
  Chaos in Wiggins's sense is not a sufficient condition for chaos in Li-Yorke's sense.  
  \begin{proof}
    Sturmian System.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\citet{aulbach} has shown that Li-Yorke's and Block-Coppel's definitions are weaker than Devaney's definition.
\begin{theorem}
  \citep{aulbach} 
  The adding machine is chaotic in Li-Yorke's sense \textbf{and} in Block-Coppel's sense.
  However, the system is not chaotic in Devaney's sense.
  \begin{proof}
    (Adding machine example)
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
