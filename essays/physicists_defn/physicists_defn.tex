\section{What do physicists say?}
Although there is no universally accepted definition of chaos,
most experts would concur that chaos is the {\it aperiodic,
  long-term behavior of a bounded, deterministic system
that exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions} (Sprott, p104)

Positive Lyapunov exponent, (Kantz)
Aperiodic and unstable orbits (claim by Martelli)

``We say that motion on an attractor is chaotic if
it displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions.'' (Ott p11)
``[\ldots] two key aspects of chaos are the stretching of infinitesimal displacements
and the complex orbit structure in the form of a vast variety of possible orbits.'' (Ott p31)
