Lacunarity - the 'texture' of a fractal

Self-organized critical systems usually have negative Lyapunov exponent 
e.g. Sand pile model [Caglioti and Loreto 1996]

nonuniform hyperbolic theory (Pesin's theory)

A stochastic system has a randomly distributed error
In a chaotic system nearby initial values will be far
away in t -> large.

"In the beginning, there was only chaos, the Abyss" (Hesiod?)

"Given for one instant an intelligence which
could comprehend all the forces by which nature
is animated and the respective positions of the
beings which compose it, if moreover this
intelligence were vast enough to submit these
data to analysis, it would embrace in the same
formula both the movements of the largest bodies
in the universe and those of the lightsest atom;
to it nothing would be uncertain, and the future
as the past would be present to its eyes."
(P. Laplace)

"A strange attractor seems strange only to a stranger."
(Boris Chirikov, Felix Izrailev in "The Essense of Chaos")
