Lacunarity - the 'texture' of a fractal

Self-organized critical systems usually have negative Lyapunov exponent 
e.g. Sand pile model [Caglioti and Loreto 1996]

nonuniform hyperbolic theory (Pesin's theory)

A stochastic system has a randomly distributed error
In a chaotic system nearby initial values will be far
away in t -> large.
