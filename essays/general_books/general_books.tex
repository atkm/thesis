  By symmetry we mean an invariance against change: something stays the same, in spite of some potentially consequential alteration.
p.xv
  The workd \textit{symmetric} is of ancient Greek parentage and means well-proportioned, well-ordered--certainly nothing even remotely chaotic.
  Yet, paradoxically, self-similarity, the topic of this tome, alone among all the symmetries gives birth to its very antithesis: \textit{chaos},
  a state of utter confusion and disorder.
