\chapter{Devaney's Definition}
\label{chap:devaney}
\citet{devaney} defines chaos in topological dynamics using three properties.
We first state the definition, and 
Throughout this chapter, $X$ is a compact metric space, and $d$ is the metric associated with the space.
\begin{definition}
  (Chaos in the sense of Devaney) 
  A continuous map $F: X\rar X$ is said to be chaotic on $X$ if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Periodic points are dense in $X$.
    \item $F$ is \textit{topologically transitive}.
    \item $F$ has \textit{sensitive dependence on initial conditions}.
  \end{enumerate}
  \index{definition of chaos!Devaney}
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}
  (Dense Periodic Points) 
  Let $F: X \to X$.
  Define $P(F)$ to be the set of periodic points of the map.
  We say that $F$ has dense periodic points if $P(F)$ is dense in $X$.
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}
  (Topological Transitivity) 
  $F: X \rar X$ is said to be \textit{topologically transitive} if for any pair of open sets $U$, $V \subseteq X$ there exists $k > 0$ such that $\itr{F}{k}(U) \cap V \neq \emptyset$.
  \label{defn:transitivity}
  \index{topological transitivity}
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}
  (Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions) 
  $F: X \rightarrow X$ is said to have \textit{sensitive dependence on initial conditions} if there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that, for any $x \in X$ and any neighborhood $N$ of $x$, there exists $y\in N$ and $n\geq 0$ such that 
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{n}(x), \itr{F}{n}(y)} > \epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
  \label{defn:sdic}
  \index{sensitive dependence on initial conditions}
\end{definition}
%
\noindent Note that for sensitive dependence on initial conditions we do \textit{not} require \textit{all} points near $x$ need eventually separate from $x$ under iteration.
The existence of one such point in every neighborhood of $x$ suffices.

Recall from the previous chapter that sensitive dependence on initial conditions, measured by Lyapunov expoenents, are regarded as the condition that gives rise to complex behavior.
%
\begin{example}
  (Rotation by magnitude is chaotic)
  Let $D = \set{x \in \R^2: \norm{x} \leq 2}$, and $C_\rho = \set{x \in \R^2: \norm{x} = \rho}$.
  Define $F: D \to D$, a rotation in $C_\rho$, by
  \begin{equation*}
    F(x) = F(\rho, \theta) = (\rho, \theta + \rho).
  \end{equation*}
  For every $\rho \in (0,2]$, $C_\rho$ is invariant.

  We claim that the system has in $C_\rho$ sensitive dependence on initial conditions with $r_0 = \rho$.
  Let $x_0 = (\rho_0, \theta_0)$ and $d > 0$.
  Choose $n$ large enough that $\frac{\pi}{n} < d$ and $\rho_0 - \frac{\pi}{n} > 0$.
  Let $y_0 = (\rho_0 - \frac{\pi}{n}, \theta_0)$.
  Then,
  \begin{equation*}
    x_n = (\rho_0, \theta_0 + n\rho_0),\quad
    y_n = (\rho_0 - \frac{\pi}{n}, \theta_0 + n\rho_0 - \pi),
  \end{equation*}
  so
  \begin{equation*}
    \norm{x_0 - y_0} < d \quad \mbox{and} \quad \norm{y_n - x_n} = \paren*{\frac{\pi}{n}}^2 + \pi^2 > 2 > r_0.
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $D \subseteq \R^2$ a closed disk centered at the origin with radius 1.
  Let $F: D \to D$ be defined as
  \begin{equation*}
    F: (\rho, \theta) \mapsto (4\rho(1 - \rho), \theta + 1).
  \end{equation*}
  The origin is the only fixed point.
  $F$ does not have a periodic orbit of period greater than 1.
  Hence, the periodic points of $F$ is not dense in $D$ so that $F$ is not chaotic in the sense of Devaney.
\end{example}

\citet{banks} showed that sensitive dependence on initial conditions can be derived from transivity and dense periodic orbits property if the mapping is continuous and $X$ is a compact, invariant set. 

\begin{theorem}
  (Topological Transitivity and Dense Periodic Points Imply Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions)
  Let $F: X\rar X$ be a chaotic transformation. Then there is an $\epsilon > 0$ such that
  for any $x\in X$ and any open set $J$ containing at least $x$ and another point, there is
  a point $y\in J$ and $n\in \N$ with
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{n}(x),\itr{F}{n}(y)} > \epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
  \label{thm:banks}
\end{theorem}
First, we shall prove a lemma that is essential to the proof of the theorem.
Two distincy periodic orbits cannot intersect.
This observation results in the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
  Let $F: X\rar X$ be a mapping with (at least) two distinct periodic orbits.
  Then there is a $c > 0$ such that for any $x\in X$ there exists a periodic
  point $p$ such that for each $k$
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{x, \itr{F}{k}(p)} > c.
  \end{equation*}
  \label{lem:dev1}
\begin{proof}[Proof of the lemma]
  Let $r$ and $s$ be periodic points with distinct orbits. For each $k$ and $l$ we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r), \itr{F}{l}(s)} > 0.
  \end{equation*}
  Choose $c$ so that $2c < \min \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),\itr{F}{l}(s)}$.
  Then by the triangle inequality
  \begin{equation*}
    2c < \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),\itr{F}{l}(s)} \leq \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),x} + \metric{x,\itr{F}{l}(s)}
  \end{equation*}
  for all $k$ and $l$.
  Now suppose that $\metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),x} \leq c$ and $\metric{x,\itr{F}{l}(s)} \leq c$. The supposition
  violates the inequality just derived. Thus 
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),x} > c \mbox{ or } \metric{x,\itr{F}{l}(s)} > c
  \end{equation*}
  must hold.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}
%
\begin{proof}[Proof of \ref{thm:banks}]
  Let $x$ be any point of $X$ and $J$ any open set containing $x$.
  Since the periodic points of $f$ are dense (in $X$), we may introduce a periodic point
  $q$ of $f$ in $U$ defined as
  \begin{equation*}
    U \ceq J\cap \oball{\epsilon}{x}.
  \end{equation*}
  Let $n$ be the period of $q$.
  Apply Lemma~\ref{lem:dev1} to obtain a periodic orbit $O(p)$ and a constant $c > 0$ such that $\metric{x, O(p)} > c$.
  Let $\epsilon \ceq c/4$ so that $\metric{x, O(p)} > 4\epsilon$.
  Define
  \begin{equation*}
    W_i := \oball{\epsilon}{\itr{F}{i}(p)} \quad\text{ and }\quad V := \bigcap\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \itr{F}{-i}(W_i).
  \end{equation*}
  Since $\itr{F}{i}(p) \in W_i$, we see that $p \in V$, and $V$ is not empty. 
  Also note that $V$ is open.
  By the transitivity property, we can find a $z\in U$ and a positive integer $k$ such that
  $\itr{F}{k}(z) \in V$. Let $j$ be the least integer such that $k < nj$. 
  That is,
  \begin{equation*}
    1 \leq nj - k \leq n.
  \end{equation*}
  Therefore,
  \begin{equation*}
    \itr{F}{nj} (z) = \itr{F}{nj - k} (\itr{F}k(z)) \in \itr{F}{nj-k}(V).
  \end{equation*}
  Also,
  \begin{equation*}
     \itr{F}{nj - k}(V) \subset \itr{F}{nj - k}(\itr{F}{-(nj - k)} W_{nj-k}) 
     = W_{nj-k}
     \equiv \oball{\epsilon}{\itr{F}{nj-k}(p)}.
  \end{equation*}
  The last two equalities imply
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(z), \itr{F}{nj - k}(p)} < \epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
  Furthermore, $\itr{F}{nj}(q) = q$, since $q$ is a $n$-periodic point 
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(q), \itr{F}{nj}(z)} = \metric{q, \itr{F}{nj}(z)}.
  \end{equation*}
  By the triangle inequality, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{x, \itr{F}{nj-k}(p)} \leq \metric{x,q} + \metric{q, \itr{F}{nj}(z)} + \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(z), \itr{F}{nj - k}(p)}.
  \end{equation*}
  Finally, 
  \begin{align*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(q), \itr{F}{nj}(z)} 
    &= \metric{q, \itr{F}{nj}(z)}  \\
    &\geq  \metric{x, \itr{F}{nj-k}(p)} - \metric{x,q} - \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(z), \itr{F}{nj - k}(p)}  \\
    &> 4\epsilon - \epsilon - \epsilon 
    = 2\epsilon,
  \end{align*}
  which implies
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(q), \itr{F}{nj}(x)} + \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(x), \itr{F}{nj}(z)} 
    \geq \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(q), \itr{F}{nj}(z)}
    > 2\epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
  It follows from the inequality that 
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(x), \itr{F}{nj}(z)} \geq \epsilon \quad\mbox{ or }\quad \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(x), \itr{F}{nj}(q)} \geq \epsilon 
  \end{equation*}
   must hold.

\end{proof}

Furthermore, in an interval, topological transitivity implies the other two (Vellekoop-Berglund, 1994).
A system is chaotic in $X$ in the sense of Devaney if and only if for every pair of open sets in $X$ there exists a periodic orbit which visits both sets (Touhey, 1997).

In particular, we mainly consider conjugation by continuous, surjective transformations.
In some cases, we will consider conjugation by homeomorphism.
\begin{theorem}
  (Transitivity and Conjugacy) 
  Let $F: X \to X$, $G: Y \to Y$, and $H: X \to Y$.
  Suppose that $G \compose H = H \compose F$.
  Suppose $H$ is continuous and surjective, and $F$ is transitive.
  Then $G$ is transitive.
  If $H$ is a homeomorphism, then $F$ is transitive if and only if $G$ is transitive.
\end{theorem}
A similar theorem for dense periodic orbits.
\begin{theorem}
  (Dense Periodic Orbits and Conjugacy) 
  Suppose that $G \compose H = H \compose F$.
  Suppose $H$ is continuous and surjective, and $P(F)$ is dense in $X$.
  Then $P(G)$ is dense in $Y$.
\end{theorem}
Note that in the proof, we proved the following
\begin{theorem}
  (Period is preserved under conjugacy)
\end{theorem}
