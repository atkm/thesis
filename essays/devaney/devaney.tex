\label{chap:devaney}
\section{Chaos in Devaney's Sense}
Throughout this chapter, $X$ is a metric space, and $d$ is the metric associated with the space, $F$ is a continuous map from $X$ to $X$.
\citet{devaney} defines chaos using three properties.
We first state the definition of chaos, then define individual terms.
\begin{definition}
  (Chaos in Devaney's sense) 
  A continuous map $F: X\rar X$ is said to be chaotic on $X$ if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Periodic points are dense in $X$.
    \item $F$ is \textit{topologically transitive}.
    \item $F$ has \textit{sensitive dependence on initial conditions}.
  \end{enumerate}
  \index{definition of chaos!Devaney}
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}
  (Dense Periodic Points) 
  Let $F: X \to X$.
  Define $P(F)$ to be the set of periodic points of the map.
  We say that $F$ has dense periodic points if $P(F)$ is dense in $X$.
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}
  (Topological Transitivity) 
  $F: X \rar X$ is said to be \textit{topologically transitive} if for any pair of open sets $U$, $V \subseteq X$ there exists $k > 0$ such that $\itr{F}{k}(U) \cap V \neq \emptyset$.
  \label{defn:transitivity}
  \index{topological transitivity}
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}
  (Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions) 
  $F: X \rightarrow X$ is said to have \textit{sensitive dependence on initial conditions} if there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that, for any $x \in X$ and any neighborhood $N$ of $x$, there exists $y\in N$ and $n\geq 0$ such that 
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{n}(x), \itr{F}{n}(y)} > \epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
  \label{defn:sdic}
  \index{sensitive dependence on initial conditions}
\end{definition}
%
\begin{remark}
  Note that sensitive dependence on initial conditions does \textit{not} mean that \textit{all} points near $x$ eventually separate from $x$ under iteration.
The existence of one such point in every neighborhood of $x$ suffices.
Therefore, if there were an isolated point in the space, the dynamical system cannot be sensitive to initial conditions.
\end{remark}

Devaney motivates his definition as follows \citep[p.50]{devaney}:
\begin{quotation}
  [A] chaotic map possesses three ingredients:
  unpredictability, indecomposability, and an element of regularity.
  A chaotic system is unpredictable because of the sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
  It cannot be broken down or decomposed into two subsystems (two invariant open subsets) which do not interact under $f$ because of topological transitivity.
  And, in the midst of this random behavior, we nevertheless have an element of regularity, namely the periodic points which are dense.
\end{quotation}
While topological transitivity and sensitive dependence on initial conditions are natural requirements for chaotic dynamics, the last sentence about periodic orbits is noteworthy.
As we will see later in the examples, classical examples of chaotic systems possess dense periodic orbits.
Nevertheless, whether dense periodic orbits should be included in the definition of chaotic dynamical system should be considered with care.
In fact, some authors simply omit this condition.
We attribute this version of definition to Wiggins.
\begin{definition}
  (Chaos in Wiggins's sense)
  A continuous map $F: X\rar X$ is said to be chaotic on $X$ if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $F$ is \textit{topologically transitive}.
    \item $F$ has \textit{sensitive dependence on initial conditions}.
  \end{enumerate}
  \index{definition of chaos!Wiggins}
\end{definition}

We give some examples to illustrate the two definitions.
  \begin{example}
    (Devaney, 1987)
    An irrational rotation of the unit circle is topologically transitive, but not sensitive to initial conditions.
    All points remain the same distance apart after iteration.
  \end{example}
  \begin{example}
    (Devaney, 1987)
    The doubling map on the unit circle is chaotic in Devaney's sense.
  \end{example}
  \begin{example}
    The logistic map $L_\mu$ (we defined this mapping in the introduction) is chaotic on its attractor when $\mu > 2 + \sqrt{5}$.
    Note that we cannot say that $L_\mu$ is chaotic on $I \equiv [0,1]$, since it does not satisfy the second condition, topological transitivity.
  \end{example}
  \begin{example}
    (Rotation by magnitude is chaotic \citep{martelli})
    Let $D = \set{v \in \R^2: \norm{v} \leq 2}$, and $C_r = \set{v \in \R^2: \norm{v} = r}$.
    Define $F: D \to D$, a rotation in $C_r$, by
    \begin{equation*}
      F(x) = F(r, \theta) = (r, \theta + r).
    \end{equation*}
    For every $r \in (0,2]$, $C_r$ is invariant.
    We claim that the system has in $C_r$ sensitive dependence on initial conditions with $r_0 = r$.
    Let $x_0 = (r_0, \theta_0)$ and $d > 0$.
    Choose $n$ large enough that $\frac{\pi}{n} < d$ and $r_0 - \frac{\pi}{n} > 0$.
    Let $y_0 = (r_0 - \frac{\pi}{n}, \theta_0)$.
    Then,
    \begin{equation*}
      x_n = (r_0, \theta_0 + nr_0),\quad
      y_n = (r_0 - \frac{\pi}{n}, \theta_0 + nr_0 - \pi),
    \end{equation*}
    so
    \begin{equation*}
      \norm{x_0 - y_0} < d \quad\mbox{and}\quad \norm{y_n - x_n} = \paren*{\frac{\pi}{n}}^2 + \pi^2 > 2 > r_0.
    \end{equation*}
  \end{example}
  %%%
  \begin{example}
    We give this dynamical system as an example of a system that is topologically transitive and sensitive to initial conditions, but does not have dense periodic orbits \citep{martelli}.
    Let $D \subseteq \R^2$ a closed disk centered at the origin with radius 1.
    Let $F: D \to D$ be defined as
    \begin{equation*}
      F: (r, \theta) \mapsto (4r(1 - r), \theta + 1).
    \end{equation*}
    The origin is the only fixed point.
    $F$ does not have a periodic orbit of period greater than 1.
    Hence, the periodic points of $F$ is not dense in $D$ so that $F$ is not chaotic in the sense of Devaney.
    However, $F$ is chaotic in the sense of Wiggins.
    This example raises the question of what we really mean by the term ``chaotic.''
  \end{example}
  \begin{example}
    (Twist Map \citep{wiggins})
  \end{example}

\section{Dense Periodic Orbits and Topological Transitivity Implies Sensitivity}
\citet{silverman} (and later \citet{banks}) showed that sensitive dependence on initial conditions is derived from transivity and dense periodic orbits property if the mapping is continuous and $X$ is a compact (?), invariant set. 
From now on, we can regard dense periodic orbits and topological transitivity as sufficient conditions for sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

\begin{theorem}
  (Topological Transitivity and Dense Periodic Points Imply Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions)
  Let $F: X\rar X$ be a chaotic transformation. Then there is an $\epsilon > 0$ such that
  for any $x\in X$ and any open set $J$ containing at least $x$ and another point, there is
  a point $y\in J$ and $n\in \N$ with
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{n}(x),\itr{F}{n}(y)} > \epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
  \label{thm:banks}
\end{theorem}
First, we prove a lemma, which says two distinct periodic orbits cannot intersect.
\begin{lemma}
  Let $F: X\rar X$ be a mapping with (at least) two distinct periodic orbits.
  Then there is a $c > 0$ such that for any $x\in X$ there exists a periodic
  point $p$ such that for each $k$
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{x, \itr{F}{k}(p)} > c.
  \end{equation*}
  \label{lem:dev1}
  \begin{proof}[Proof of the lemma]
    Let $r$ and $s$ be periodic points with distinct orbits. For each $k$ and $l$ we have
    \begin{equation*}
      \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r), \itr{F}{l}(s)} > 0.
    \end{equation*}
    Choose $c$ so that $2c < \min \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),\itr{F}{l}(s)}$.
    Then by the triangle inequality
    \begin{equation*}
      2c < \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),\itr{F}{l}(s)} \leq \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),x} + \metric{x,\itr{F}{l}(s)}
    \end{equation*}
    for all $k$ and $l$.
    We cannot have $\metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),x} \leq c$ and $\metric{x,\itr{F}{l}(s)} \leq c$, since it violates the inequality just derived.
    Thus,
    \begin{equation*}
      \metric{\itr{F}{k}(r),x} > c \mbox{ or } \metric{x,\itr{F}{l}(s)} > c
    \end{equation*}
    must hold.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
  %
\begin{proof}[Proof of \ref{thm:banks}]
  Let $x$ be any point of $X$ and $J$ any open set containing $x$.
  Since the periodic points of $f$ are dense (in $X$), we may introduce a periodic point
  $q$ of $f$ in $U$ defined as
  \begin{equation*}
    U \ceq J\cap \oball{\epsilon}{x}.
  \end{equation*}
  Let $n$ be the period of $q$.
  Apply Lemma~\ref{lem:dev1} to obtain a periodic orbit $O(p)$ and a constant $c > 0$ such that $\metric{x, O(p)} > c$.
  Let $\epsilon \ceq c/4$ so that $\metric{x, O(p)} > 4\epsilon$.
  Define
  \begin{equation*}
    W_i := \oball{\epsilon}{\itr{F}{i}(p)} \quad\text{ and }\quad V := \bigcap\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \itr{F}{-i}(W_i).
  \end{equation*}
  Since $\itr{F}{i}(p) \in W_i$, we see that $p \in V$, and $V$ is not empty. 
  Also note that $V$ is open.
  By the transitivity property, we can find a $z\in U$ and a positive integer $k$ such that
  $\itr{F}{k}(z) \in V$. Let $j$ be the least integer such that $k < nj$. 
  That is,
  \begin{equation*}
    1 \leq nj - k \leq n.
  \end{equation*}
  Therefore,
  \begin{equation*}
    \itr{F}{nj} (z) = \itr{F}{nj - k} (\itr{F}k(z)) \in \itr{F}{nj-k}(V).
  \end{equation*}
  Also,
  \begin{equation*}
    \itr{F}{nj - k}(V) \subset \itr{F}{nj - k}(\itr{F}{-(nj - k)} W_{nj-k}) 
    = W_{nj-k}
    \equiv \oball{\epsilon}{\itr{F}{nj-k}(p)}.
  \end{equation*}
  The last two equalities imply
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(z), \itr{F}{nj - k}(p)} < \epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
  Furthermore, $\itr{F}{nj}(q) = q$, since $q$ is a $n$-periodic point 
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(q), \itr{F}{nj}(z)} = \metric{q, \itr{F}{nj}(z)}.
  \end{equation*}
  By the triangle inequality, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{x, \itr{F}{nj-k}(p)} \leq \metric{x,q} + \metric{q, \itr{F}{nj}(z)} + \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(z), \itr{F}{nj - k}(p)}.
  \end{equation*}
  Finally, 
  \begin{align*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(q), \itr{F}{nj}(z)} 
    &= \metric{q, \itr{F}{nj}(z)}  \\
    &\geq  \metric{x, \itr{F}{nj-k}(p)} - \metric{x,q} - \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(z), \itr{F}{nj - k}(p)}  \\
    &> 4\epsilon - \epsilon - \epsilon 
    = 2\epsilon,
  \end{align*}
  which implies
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(q), \itr{F}{nj}(x)} + \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(x), \itr{F}{nj}(z)} 
    \geq \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(q), \itr{F}{nj}(z)}
    > 2\epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
  It follows from the inequality that 
  \begin{equation*}
    \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(x), \itr{F}{nj}(z)} \geq \epsilon \quad\mbox{ or }\quad \metric{\itr{F}{nj}(x), \itr{F}{nj}(q)} \geq \epsilon 
  \end{equation*}
  must hold.
\end{proof}

Using this result, we can restate Devaney's definition in a more concise form, since the third condition, sensitive dependence on initial condition, is redundant.
\begin{definition}
  (Chaos in Devaney's sense) 
  A continuous map $F: X\rar X$ is said to be chaotic on $X$ if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Periodic points are dense in $X$.
    \item $F$ is \textit{topologically transitive}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
%%%
Also, dense periodic orbit and sensitivity do not in general imply transitivity \citep{assaf}.
We obtain a related result when we restrict our space to a compact interval, topological transitivity implies the other two \citep{silverman}.
(Use ``Devaney's chaos revisited'')
%A system is chaotic in $X$ in the sense of Devaney if and only if for every pair of open sets in $X$ there exists a periodic orbit which visits both sets (Touhey, 1997).

A nice property of chaos in Devaney's sense is that all conditions are topological invariance, that is, the properties are preserved under conjugation by a continuous mapping.
Since the properties of our interest are global properties of a space, we also require that the mapping be 
\begin{definition}
    We say that $G$ is \textit{semi-conjugate} to $F$, if $\phi\circ F = G\circ\phi$, where $\phi$ is continuous and surjective.
\end{definition}
%\noindent\textit{Remark:} If $\phi$ were homeomorphism (i.e. $F$ is topologically conjugate to $G$), then $G$ is semi-conjugate to $F$, and at the same time, $F$ is semi-conjugate to $G$.
%  For instance, if $G$ is topologically conjugate to $F$, then $G$ is transitive if and only if $F$ is transitive.
We show that the dense periodic orbits and topological transitivity are topological invariants.
It follows that sensitive dependence on initial conditions is also a topological invariance.
We 
  \begin{theorem}
    (Transitivity and Conjugacy) 
    Let $F: X \to X$ and $G: Y \to Y$ be continuous functions, and $\phi: X \to Y$ be a continuous, surjective map.
    Suppose that $G \compose \phi = \phi \compose F$.
    If $F$ is transitive, then $G$ is transitive.
    \label{thm:conj-trans}
    \begin{proof}
      Let $A$ and $B$ be open sets of $Y$.
      Since $\phi^{-1}$ is continuous, $\phi^{-1}(A)$ is a union of open sets in $X$.
      Let $A'$ be one of the open sets constituting $\phi^{-1}(A)$.
      Similarly, let $B'$ be one of the open sets constituting $\phi^{-1}(B)$.
      By the transitivity of $F$, there exists a positive integer $n$ and $x \in B'$ such that $\itr{F}{n}(x)\in A'$.
      Let $y \ceq \phi(x)$.
      Then, $y \in B$, and 
      \begin{equation*}
        \itr{G}{n}(y) 
        = \itr{G}{n}(\phi(x))
        = \phi(\itr{F}{n}(x)) \in \phi(A') \subseteq A.
      \end{equation*}
      \end{proof}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{theorem}
    (Dense Set and Conjugacy) 
    Let $\phi$ be a continuous and surjective mapping.
    If $D$ is dense in $X$, then $\phi(D)$ is dense in $Y$.
    \label{thm:conj-dense}
    \begin{proof}
      Let $A \subseteq Y$ be an open set.
      Since $\phi$ is continuous, $\phi^{-1} (A)$ is a union of open sets.
      Let $B$ be one of the open sets that constitutes $\phi^{-1}(A)$.
      The intersection $B \cap D$ is nonempty, because $D$ is dense in $Y$.
      For each $y \in B \cap D$, we have $\phi(y) \in A \cap \phi(D)$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{theorem}
    (Period Points and Conjugacy)
    Suppose that $G \compose \phi = \phi \compose F$, where $\phi$ is continuous and surjective mapping.
    If $p$ is a $n$-periodic point of $F$, then $\phi(p)$ is a $n$-periodic point of $G$.
    \label{thm:conj-per}
    \begin{proof}
      $\itr{F}{n}(p) = p$ implies that $\itr{G}{n}(\phi(p)) = \phi(\itr{F}{n}(p)) = \phi(p)$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    Suppose that $G$ is semi-conjugate to $F$.
    If $\mathrm{P}(F)$ is dense in $X$, then $\mathrm{P}(G)$ is dense in $Y$.
    \label{cor:conj-dense-per}
    \begin{proof}
      It follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:conj-per} that $\phi(\mathrm{P}(F)) \subseteq \mathrm{P}(G)$.
      Then, by Theorem~\ref{thm:conj-dense}, $\mathrm{P}(G)$ is a dense subset of $Y$.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
We also have the following as a corollary.
\begin{corollary}
  Suppose that $G$ is semi-conjugate to $F$.
  If $F$ is sensitive to initial conditions, then $G$ is sensitive to initial conditions.
  \label{cor:conj-sdic}
  \begin{proof}
  This follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:banks}, Theorem~\ref{thm:conj-trans}, and Theorem~\ref{thm:conj-dense}.
  \end{proof}
